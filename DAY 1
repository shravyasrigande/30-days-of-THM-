Bounty Hacker
You talked a big game about being the most elite hacker in the solar system. Prove it and claim your right to the status of Elite Bounty Hacker!

Started with this room(as it is day1)
the ip address assigned was : 10.10.134.12
Task 1 (Living up to the title)
Q1 - Deployed the machine
Q2 - find all the open ports :
to find all the open ports i used the command "nmap -v -sT ip address"
i just found there are 3 open ports - 21,22, 80
then i browsed into the ip address , i found some web page hosted
and ftp has access to Anonymous
therefore logged into ftp ipaddress
get the file task.txt using "get task.txt -" such that the username will be displayed
Q3 - Who wrote the task list?
ans : lin
Q4 - What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?
we can also see one more file in ftp server which is locks.txt, i tried to open it , it looks like wordlist that can access to server . 
ans : ssh( we have a protected ssh access to the server)
Q5 - What is the users password?
Firstly we need to download locks.txt file to our machine and then brueforce 
using hydra command "hydra -l lin -P locks.txt -t 6 ssh://<ip>"
ans : RedDr4gonSynd1cat3
Q6 - user.txt 
to get this file we need to open our secured shell
therefore login using ssh@ipaddress then enter password 
then look at all the files using "ls" 
then open user.txt file using "cat user.txt" command
hurrayy! we found the flag as "THM{CR1M3_SyNd1C4T3}"
Q7 - root.txt
normally there is no such file visible to us , therefore use command "ls-la" to list hidden but still there is nothing found
login using root as sudo we got a little hint as /bin/tar. We got root access on the /bin/tar command
Then try to exploit tar so i found some reference through google .
I used this command to do "sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null — checkpoint=1 — checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh"
then i got root access
finally list files by "ls" command , we found root.txt
going through it using "cat root.txt" 
ans : THM{80UN7Y_h4cK3r}

That's it for this room ! Hope best for the rest !
